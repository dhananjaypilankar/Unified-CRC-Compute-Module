# Unified-CRC-Compute-Module (C Program)
This code is for computation of 32-bit, 16-bit and 8-bit CRC computation. The code is created keeping in mind the small footprint for any application. It does not guarantee speed. It computes CRC with CPU machine cycles and by not using pre-computed tables. Code does not take in to account post computing XOR operation. User have to use his/her own XOR code for the same.
